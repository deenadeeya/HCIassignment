**Abstract:**
This paper presents an analysis of the usability of two popular messaging apps, WhatsApp and Telegram, as part of the
Human-Computer Interaction (SECV2113) course at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [1]. A survey involving 10 participants, including friends and relatives of the author, was conducted to assess user experiences with the apps. Participants rated their experiences using a Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) across 10 statements related to aspects such as usage frequency, complexity, ease of use, support needs, functionality, learning curve, and confidence. The results provide valuable insights into user perceptions of these apps, contributing to a deeper understanding of their usability in the context of mobile communication tools.
